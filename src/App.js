        Hi, my name is Maksym. 
        I'm a full-stack developer, team lead, and software architect with 10+ years of experience.
        I'm from Ukraine. Was based, and worked a lot in Malta.
        My specialty is web development using the .Net stack,
        JS with modern frameworks like Angular and React,
        and a lot of infrastructure tools and applications like SQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, Docker, Kubernetes,
        and more.
